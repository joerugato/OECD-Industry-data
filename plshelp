Hi there klanomath.

I have searched to find your contact details for awhile, however I have not been able to see your email or a direct message link anywhere...

hopefully you see this, and apologies for the unorthadox approach.


I have a mac error almost identical to many questions you have answered on stackexchange, eg..:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/310744/partition-type-ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff?rq=1



I was wondering if you could help me - tried to follow guides but you gpt add etc etc.. wont work..

If you are happy to help, happy to arrange an appropriate payment for your time - i think for somebody of your expertise
  it could be quite simple.
  
  
  please let me know!
  
  Feel free to get in touch with me via joseph.rugari@adelaide.edu.au
  
  
  I will be sure to pull this file down
